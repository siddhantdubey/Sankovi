Please return a JSON object containing the suggested changes in a format similar to the git diff system, showing whether a line is added, removed, or edited for each file.
    For example, the JSON output should look like:
    {{
    "intent": "This should be what you think the program SHOULD do.",
    "explanation": "Explanation of what went wrong and the changes being made",
    "files": [
        {{
            "file_name": "file_name.py",
            "changes": [
                {{
                "action": "edit",
                "line_number": 2,
                "new_line": "print('hello world')",
                }},
                {{
                "action": "add",
                "line_number": 3,
                "new_line": "hello="world"\nprint(hello)\nprint(1 + 2)",
                }},
                {{
                "action": "remove",
                "line_number": 4,
                "new_line": "",
                }},
            ]
        }},
    ]
    }}
    In the 'action' field, please use "add" for adding a line, this will put the line after the line number, "remove" for removing a line, and "edit" for editing a line. Please provide the suggested changes in this format. The code has line numbers prepended to each line in the format "1:print('hello world')", so you can use that to determine the line number on which to make a change. Edits are applied in reverse line order so that the line numbers don't change as you edit the code.PLAY VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO INDENTATION AND WHITESPACE, THIS IS PYTHON AFTER ALL! DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THE FORMAT IT MUST BE ABLE TO BE PARSED BY ME! You will be penalized if you do. ONLY RETURN JSON, DON'T EXPLAIN YOURSELF UNLESS IN THE EXPLANATION FIELD. DON'T INCLUDE MARKDOWN BACKTICKS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, JUST THE JSON.
