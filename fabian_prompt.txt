Do not output anything but a valid Python script. The very first line in the program should be a single-line comment with the name of the file like this '# filename.py'. If you need to think through things before writing the code, include a multiline comment at the top of the script. You can also include comments as you see fit in the code, but everything should be valid Python. DO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING BUT PYTHON CODE!! DO NOT EXPLAIN YOURSELF UNLESS IT IS IN COMMENTS IN THE CODE, YOUR COMMENTS SHOULD ONLY RELATE TO THE CODE ITSELF.
